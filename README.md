# Assessment of unsteady flow predictions using hybrid deep learning based reduced order models
Currently the code for POD-RNN method described in the paper is inlcuded here for stationary cylinder. 
We will updating this repository with more code and results of the paper in the coming days.
The manuscript is under review in Physics of Fluids. The arXiv version can be accessed here https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04396
